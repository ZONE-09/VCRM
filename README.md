Excerpt From *The Complete Works of the Swami Vivekananda, Part 2*: A Study of the Sāṅkhya Philosophy By Swami Vivekananda[^17]

</summary>
  
Prakriti is called by the Sāṅkhya philosophers indiscrete, and defined
as the perfect balance of the materials in it; and it naturally follows
that in perfect balance there cannot be any motion. In the primal state
before any manifestation, when there was no motion but perfect balance,
this Prakriti was indestructible, because decomposition or death comes
from instability or change. Again, according to the Sāṅkhya, atoms are
not the primal state. This universe does not come out of atoms: they may
be the secondary or the tertiary state. The primordial material may form
into atoms and become grosser and bigger things; and as far as modern
investigations go, they rather point towards the same conclusion. For
instance, in the modern theory of ether, if you say ether is atomic, it
will not solve anything. To make it clearer, say that air is composed of
atoms, and we know that ether is everywhere, interpenetrating,
omnipresent, and that these air atoms are floating, as it were, in
ether. If ether again be composed of atoms, there will still be spaces
between every two atoms of ether. What fills up these? If you suppose
that there is another ether still finer which does this, there will
again be other spaces between the atoms of that finer ether which
require filling up, and so it will be regressus ad infinitum, what the
Sāṅkhya philosophers call the "cause leading to nothing" So the atomic
theory cannot be final. According to Sāṅkhya, nature is omnipresent, one
omnipresent mass of nature, in which are the causes of everything that
exists. What is meant by cause? Cause is the fine state of the
manifested state; the unmanifested state of that which becomes
manifested. What do you mean by destruction? It is reverting to the
cause If you have a piece of pottery and give it a blow, it is
destroyed. What is meant by this is that the effects go back to their
own nature, they materials out of which the pottery was created go back
into their original state. Beyond this idea of destruction, any idea
such as annihilation is on the face of it absurd. According to modern
physical science, it can be demonstrated that all destruction means that
which Kapila said ages ago — simply reverting to the cause. Going back
to the finer form is all that is meant by destruction. You know how it
can be demonstrated in a laboratory that matter is indestructible. At
this present stage of our knowledge, if any man stands up and says that
matter or this soul becomes annihilated, he is only making himself,
ridiculous; it is only uneducated, silly people who would advance such a
proposition; and it is curious that modern knowledge coincides with what
those old philosophers taught. It must be so, and that is the proof of
truth. They proceeded in their inquiry, taking up mind as the basis;
they analysed the mental part of this universe and came to certain
conclusions, which we, analysing the physical part, must come to, for
they both must lead to the same centre.

You must remember that the first manifestation of this Prakriti in the
cosmos is what the Sāṅkhya calls "Mahat". We may call it intelligence —
the great principle, its literal meaning. The first change in Prakriti
is this intelligence; I would not translate it by self-consciousness,
because that would be wrong. Consciousness is only a part of this
intelligence. Mahat is universal. It covers all the grounds of
sub-consciousness, consciousness, and super-consciousness; so any one
state of consciousness, as applied to this Mahat, would not be
sufficient. In nature, for instance, you note certain changes going on
before your eyes which you see and understand, but there are other
changes, so much finer, that no human perception can catch them. The are
from the same cause, the same Mahat is making these changes. Out of
Mahat comes universal egoism. These are all substance. There is no
difference between matter and mind, except in degree. The substance is
the same in finer or grosser form; one changes into the other, and this
exactly coincides with the conclusions of modern physiological research.
By believing in the teaching that the mind is not separate from the
brain, you will be saved from much fighting and struggling. Egoism again
changes into two varieties. In one variety it changes into the organs.
Organs are of two kinds, organs of sensation and organs of reaction.
They are not the eyes or the ears, but back of those are what you call
brain-centres, and nerve-centres, and so on. This egoism, this matter or
substance, becomes changed, and out of this material are manufactured
these centres. Of the same substance is manufactured the other variety,
the Tanmatras, fine particles of matter, which strike our organs of
perception and bring about sensations. You cannot perceive them but only
know they are there. Out of the Tanmatras is manufactured the gross
matter — earth, water, and all the things that we see and feel. I want
to impress this on your mind. It is very, hard to grasp it, because in
Western countries the ideas are so queer about mind and matter. It is
hard to get those impressions out of our brains. I myself had a
tremendous difficulty, being educated in Western philosophy in my
boyhood. These are all cosmic things. Think of this universal extension
of matter, unbroken, one substance, undifferentiated, which is the first
state of everything, and which begins to change in the same way as milk
becomes curd. This first change is called Mahat. The substance Mahat
changes into the grosser matter called egoism. The third change is
manifested as universal sense-organs, and universal fine particles, and
these last again combine and become this gross universe which with eyes,
nose, and ears, we see, smell, and hear. This is the cosmic plan
according to the Sāṅkhya, and what is in the cosmos must also be
microcosmic. Take an individual man. He has first a part of
undifferentiated nature in him, and that material nature in him becomes
changed into this Mahat, a small particle of this universal
intelligence, and this particle of universal intelligence in him becomes
changed into egoism, and then into the sense-organs and the fine
particles of matter which combine and manufacture his body. I want this
to be clear, because it is the stepping-stone to Sāṅkhya, and it is
absolutely necessary for you to understand it, because this is the basis
of the philosophy of the whole world. There is no philosophy in the
world that is not indebted to Kapila. Pythagoras came to India and
studied this philosophy, and that was the beginning of the philosophy of
the Greeks. Later, it formed the Alexandrian school, and still later,
the Gnostic. It became divided into two; one part went to Europe and
Alexandria, and the other remained in India; and out of this, the system
of Vyasa was developed. The Sāṅkhya philosophy of Kapila was the first
rational system that the world ever saw. Every metaphysician in the
world must pay homage to him. I want to impress on your mind that we are
bound to listen to him as the great father of philosophy. This wonderful
man, the most ancient of philosophers, is mentioned even in the Shruti:
"O Lord, Thou who produced the sage Kapila in the Beginning." How
wonderful his perceptions were, and if there is ant proof required of
the extraordinary power of the perception of Yogis, such men are the
proof. They had no microscopes or telescopes. Yet how fine their
perception was, how perfect and wonderful their analysis of things!

I will here point out the difference between Schopenhauer and the Indian
philosophy. Schopenhauer says that desire, or will, is the cause of
everything. It is the will to exist that make us manifest, but we deny
this. The will is identical with the motor nerves. When I see an object
there is no will; when its sensations are carried to the brain, there
comes the reaction, which says "Do this", or "Do not do this", and this
state of the ego-substance is what is called will. There cannot be a
single particle of will which is not a reaction. So many things precede
will. It is only a manufactured something out of the ego, and the ego is
a manufacture of something still higher — the intelligence — and that
again is a modification of the indiscrete nature. That was the
Buddhistic idea, that whatever we see is the will. It is psychologically
entirely wrong, because will can only be identified with the motor
nerves. If you take out the motor nerves, a man has no will whatever.
This fact, as is perhaps well known to you, has been found out after a
long series of experiments made with the lower animals.

We will take up this question. It is very important to understand this
question of Mahat in man, the great principle, the intelligence. This
intelligence itself is modified into what we call egoism, and this
intelligence is the cause of all the powers in the body. It covers the
whole ground, sub-consciousness, consciousness, and super-consciousness.
What are these three states? The sub-conscious state we find in animals,
which we call instinct. This is almost infallible, but very limited.
Instinct rarely fails. An animal almost instinctively knows a poisonous
herb from an edible one, but its instinct is very limited. As soon as
something new comes, it is blind. It works like a machine. Then comes a
higher state of knowledge which is fallible and makes mistakes often,
but has a larger scope, although it is slow, and this you call reason.
It is much larger than instinct, but instinct is surer than reason.
There are more chances of mistakes in reasoning than in instinct. There
is a still higher state of the mind, the super-conscious, which belongs
only to Yogis, to men who have cultivated it. This is infallible and
much more unlimited in its scope than reason. This is the highest state.
So we must remember, this Mahat is the real cause of all that is here,
that which manifests itself in various ways, covers the whole ground of
sub-conscious, conscious, and super-conscious, the three states in which
knowledge exists.

Now comes a delicate question which is being always asked. If a perfect
God created the universe, why is there imperfection in it? What we call
the universe is what we see, and that is only this little plane of
consciousness and reason; beyond that we do not see at all. Now the very
question is an impossible one. If I take only a small portion out of a
mass of something and look at it, it seems to be inharmonious.
Naturally. The universe is inharmonious because we make it so. How? What
is reason? What is knowledge? Knowledge is finding the association about
things. You go into the street and see a man and say, I know this is a
man; because you remember the impressions on your mind, the marks on the
Chitta. You have seen many men, and each one has made an impression on
your mind; and as you see this man, you refer this to your store and see
many similar pictures there; and when you see them, you are satisfied,
and you put this new one with the rest. When a new impression comes and
it has associations in your mind, you are satisfied; and this state of
association is called knowledge. Knowledge is, therefore, pigeon-holing
one experience with the already existing fund of experience, and this is
one of the great proofs of the fact that you cannot have any knowledge
until you have already a fund in existence. If you are without
experience, as some European philosophers think, and that your mind is a
tabula rasa to begin with, you cannot get any knowledge, because the
very fact of knowledge is the recognition of the new by means of
associations already existing in the mind. There must be a store at hand
to which to refer a new impression. Suppose a child is born into this
world without such a fund, it would be impossible for him ever to get
any knowledge. Therefore, the child must have been previously in a state
in which he had a fund, and so knowledge is eternally increasing. Slow
me a way of getting round this argument. It is a mathematical fact. Some
Western schools of philosophy also hold that there cannot be any
knowledge without a fund of past knowledge. They have framed the idea
that the child is born with knowledge. These Western philosophers say
that the impressions with which the child comes into the world are not
due to the child's past, but to the experiences of his forefathers: it
is only hereditary transmission. Soon they will find out that this idea
is all wrong; some German philosophers are now giving hard blows to
these heredity ideas. Heredity is very good, but incomplete, it only
explains the physical side. How do you explain the environments
influencing us? Many causes produce one effect. Environment is one of
the modifying effects. We make our own environment: as our past is, so
we find the present environment. A drunken man naturally gravitates to
the lowest slums of the city.

You understand what is meant by knowledge. Knowledge is pigeon-holing a
new impression with old ones, recognising a new impression. What is
meant by recognition? Finding associations with similar impressions that
one already has. Nothing further is meant by knowledge. If that is the
case, if knowledge means finding the associations, then it must be that
to know anything we have to set the whole series of its similars. Is it
not so? Suppose you take a pebble; to find the association, you have to
see the whole series of pebbles similes to it. But with our perception
of the universe as a whole we cannot do that, because in the pigeon-hole
of our mind there is only one single record of the perception, we have
no other perception of the same nature or class, we cannot compare it
with any other. We cannot refer it to its associations. This bit of the
universe, cut off by our consciousness, is a startling new thing,
because we have not been able to find its associations. Therefore, we
are struggling with it, and thinking it horrible, wicked, and bad; we
may sometimes think it is good, but we always think it is imperfect. It
is only when we find its associations that the universe can be known. We
shall recognise it when we go beyond the universe and consciousness, and
then the universe will stand explained. Until we can do that, all the
knocking of our heads against a wall will never explain the universe,
because knowledge is the finding of similars, and this conscious plane
only gives us one single perception of it. So with our idea of God. All
that we see of God is only a part just as we see only one portion of the
universe, and all the rest is beyond human cognition. "I, the universal;
so great am I that even this universe is but a part of Me." That is why
we see God as imperfect, and do not understand Him. The only way to
understand Him and the universe is to go beyond reason, beyond
consciousness. "When thou goest beyond the heard and the hearing, the
thought and the thinking, then alone wilt thou come to Truth." "Go thou
beyond the scriptures, because they teach only up to nature, up to the
three qualities." When we go beyond them, we find the harmony, and not
before.

The microcosm and the macrocosm are built on exactly the same plan, and
in the microcosm we know only one part, the middle part. We know neither
the sub-conscious, nor the super-conscious. We know the conscious only.
If a man stands up and says, "I am a sinner", he makes an untrue
statement because he does not know himself. He is the most ignorant of
men; of himself he knows only one part, because his knowledge covers
only a part of the ground he is on. So with this universe, it is
possible to know only a part of it with the reason, not the whole of it;
for the sub-conscious, the conscious and the super-conscious, the
individual Mahat and the universal Mahat, and all the subsequent
modifications, constitute the universe.

What makes nature (Prakriti) change? We see so far that everything, all
Prakriti, is Jada, insentient. It is all compound and insentient.
Wherever there is law, it is proof that the region of its play is
insentient. Mind, intelligence, will, and everything else is insentient.
But they are all reflecting the sentiency, the "Chit" of some being who
is beyond all this, whom the Sāṅkhya philosophers call "Purusha". The
Purusha is the unwitting cause of all the changes in the universe. That
is to say, this Purusha, taking Him in the universal sense, is the God
of the universe. It is said that the will of the Lord created the
universe. It is very good as a common expression, but we see it cannot
be true. How could it be will? Will is the third or fourth manifestation
in nature. Many things exist before it, and what created them? Will is a
compound, and everything that is a compound is a product of nature.
Will, therefore, could not create nature. So, to say that the will of
the Lord created the universe is meaningless. Our will only covers a
little portion of self-consciousness and moves our brain. It is not will
that is working your body or that is working the universe. This body is
being moved by a power of which will is only a manifestation in one
part. Likewise in the universe there is will, but that is only one part
of the universe. The whole of the universe is not guided by will; that
is why we cannot explain it by the will theory. Suppose I take it for
granted that it is will moving the body, then, when I find I cannot work
it at will, I begin to fret and fume. It is my fault, because I had no
right to take the will theory for granted. In the same way, if I take
the universe and think it is will that moves it and find things which do
not coincide, it is my fault. So the Purusha is not will; neither can it
be intelligence, because intelligence itself is a compound. There cannot
be any intelligence without some sort of matter corresponding to the
brain. Wherever there is intelligence, there must be something akin to
that matter which we call brain which becomes lumped together into a
particular form and serves the purpose of the brain. Wherever there is
intelligence, there must be that matter in some form or other. But
intelligence itself is a compound. What then is this Purusha? It is
neither intelligence nor will, but it is the cause of all these. It is
its presence that sets them all going and combining. It does not mix
with nature; it is not intelligence, or Mahat; but the Self, the pure,
is Purusha. "I am the witness, and through my witnessing, nature is
producing; all that is sentient and all that is insentient."

What is this sentiency in nature? We find intelligence is this sentiency
which is called Chit. The basis of sentiency is in the Purusha, it is
the nature of Purusha. It is that which cannot be explained but which is
the cause of all that we call knowledge. Purusha is not consciousness,
because consciousness is a compound; buts whatever is light and good in
consciousness belongs to Purusha. Purusha is not conscious, but whatever
is light in intelligence belongs to Purusha. Sentiency is in the
Purusha, but the Purusha is not intelligent, not knowing. The Chit in
the Purusha plus Prakriti is what we see around us. Whatever is pleasure
and happiness and light in the universe belongs to Purusha; but it is a
compound, because it is Purusha plus Prakriti. "Wherever there is any
happiness, wherever there is any bliss, there is a spark of that
immortality which is God." "Purusha is the; great attraction of the
universe; though untouched by and unconnected with the universe, yet it
attracts the whole; universe." You see a man going after gold, because
behind it is a spark of the Purusha though mixed up with a good deal of
dirt. When a man loves his children or a woman her husband, what is the
attracting power? A spark of Purusha behind them. It is there, only
mixed up with "dirt". Nothing else can attract. "In this world of
insentiency the Purusha alone is sentient." This is the Purusha of the
Sāṅkhya. As such, it necessarily follows that the Purusha must be
omnipresent. That which is not omnipresent must be limited. All
limitations are caused; that which is caused must have a beginning and
end. If the Purusha is limited, it will die, will not be free, will not
be final, but must have some cause. Therefore it is omnipresent.
According to Kapila, there are many Purushas; not one, but an infinite
number of them. You and I have each of us one, and so has everyone else;
an infinite number of circles, each one infinite, running through this
universe. The Purusha is neither mind nor matter, the reflex from it is
all that we know. We are sure if it is omnipresent it has neither death
nor birth. Nature is casting her shadow upon it, the shadow of birth and
death, but it is by its nature pure. So far we have found the philosophy
of the Sāṅkhya wonderful.

Next we shall take up the proofs against it. So far the analysis is
perfect, the psychology incontrovertible. We find by the division of the
senses into organs and instruments that they are not simple, but
compound; by dividing egoism into sense and matter, we find that this is
also material and that Mahat is also a state of matter, and finally we
find the Purusha. So far there is no objection. But if we ask the
Sāṅkhya the question, "Who created nature?" — the Sāṅkhya says that the
Purusha and the Prakriti are uncreate and omnipresent, and that of this
Purusha there is an infinite number. We shall have to controvert these
propositions, and find a better solution, and by so doing we shall come
to Advaitism. Our first objection is, how can there be these two
infinites? Then our argument will be that the Sāṅkhya is not a perfect
generalization, and that we have not found in it a perfect solution. And
then we shall see how the Vedantists grope out of all these difficulties
and reach a perfect solution, and yet all the glory really belongs to
the Sāṅkhya. It is very easy to give a finishing touch to a building
when it is constructed.

Excerpt From *The Complete Works of the Swami Vivekananda, Volume 1*:What is Religion? By Swami Vivekananda[^40]

</summary>

A huge locomotive has rushed on over the line and a small worm that was
creeping upon one of the rails saved its life by crawling out of the
path of the locomotive. Yet this little worm, so insignificant that it
can be crushed in a moment, is a living something, while this
locomotive, so huge, so immense, is only an engine, a machine. You say
the one has life and the other is only dead matter and all its powers
and strength and speed are only those of a dead machine, a mechanical
contrivance. Yet the poor little worm which moved upon the rail and
which the least touch of the engine would have deprived of its life is a
majestic being compared to that huge locomotive. It is a small part of
the Infinite and, therefore, it is greater than this powerful engine.
Why should that be so? How do we know the living from the dead? The
machine mechanically performs all the movements its maker made it to
perform, its movements are not those of life. How can we make the
distinction between the living and the dead, then? In the living there
is freedom, there is intelligence; in the dead all is bound and no
freedom is possible, because there is no intelligence. This freedom that
distinguishes us from mere machines is what we are all striving for. To
be more free is the goal of all our efforts, for only in perfect freedom
can there be perfection. This effort to attain freedom underlies all
forms of worship, whether we know it or not.

If we were to examine the various sorts of worship all over the world,
we would see that the rudest of mankind are worshipping ghosts, demons,
and the spirits of their forefathers — serpent worship, worship of
tribal gods, and worship of the departed ones. Why do they do this?
Because they feel that in some unknown way these beings are greater,
more powerful than themselves, and limit their freedom. They, therefore,
seek to propitiate these beings in order to prevent them from molesting
them, in other words, to get more freedom. They also seek to win favour
from these superior beings, to get by gift of the gods what ought to be
earned by personal effort.

On the whole, this shows that the world is expecting a miracle. This
expectation never leaves us, and however we may try, we are all running
after the miraculous and extraordinary. What is mind but that ceaseless
inquiry into the meaning and mystery of life? We may say that only
uncultivated people are going after all these things, but the question
still is there: Why should it be so? The Jews were asking for a miracle.
The whole world has been asking for the same these thousands of years.
There is, again, the universal dissatisfaction. We make an ideal but we
have rushed only half the way after it when we make a newer one. We
struggle hard to attain to some goal and then discover we do not want
it. This dissatisfaction we are having time after time, and what is
there in the mind if there is to be only dissatisfaction? What is the
meaning of this universal dissatisfaction? It is because freedom is
every man's goal. He seeks it ever, his whole life is a struggle after
it. The child rebels against law as soon as it is born. Its first
utterance is a cry, a protest against the bondage in which it finds
itself. This longing for freedom produces the idea of a Being who is
absolutely free. The concept of God is a fundamental element in the
human constitution. In the Vedanta, Sat-chit-ânanda
(Existence-Knowledge-Bliss) is the highest concept of God possible to
the mind. It is the essence of knowledge and is by its nature the
essence of bliss. We have been stifling that inner voice long enough,
seeking to follow law and quiet the human nature, but there is that
human instinct to rebel against nature's laws. We may not understand
what the meaning is, but there is that unconscious struggle of the human
with the spiritual, of the lower with the higher mind, and the struggle
attempts to preserve one's separate life, what we call our
"individuality".

Even hells stand out with this miraculous fact that we are born rebels;
and the first fact of life — the inrushing of life itself — against this
we rebel and cry out, "No law for us." As long as we obey the laws we
are like machines, and on goes the universe, and we cannot break it.
Laws as laws become man's nature. The first inkling of life on its
higher level is in seeing this struggle within us to break the bond of
nature and to be free. "Freedom, O Freedom! Freedom, O Freedom!" is the
song of the soul. Bondage, alas, to be bound in nature, seems its fate.

Why should there be serpent, or ghost, or demon worship and all these
various creeds and forms for having miracles? Why do we say that there
is life, there is being in anything? There must be a meaning in all this
search, this endeavour to understand life, to explain being. It is not
meaningless and vain. It is man's ceaseless endeavour to become free.
The knowledge which we now call science has been struggling for
thousands of years in its attempt to gain freedom, and people ask for
freedom. Yet there is no freedom in nature. It is all law. Still the
struggle goes on. Nay, the whole of nature from the very sun to the
atoms is under law, and even for man there is no freedom. But we cannot
believe it. We have been studying laws from the beginning and yet cannot
— nay, will not — believe that man is under law. The soul cries ever,
"Freedom, O Freedom!" With the conception of God as a perfectly free
Being, man cannot rest eternally in this bondage. Higher he must go, and
unless the struggle were for himself, he would think it too severe. Man
says to himself, "I am a born slave, I am bound; nevertheless, there is
a Being who is not bound by nature. He is free and Master of nature."

The conception of God, therefore, is as essential and as fundamental a
part of mind as is the idea of bondage. Both are the outcome of the idea
of freedom. There cannot be life, even in the plant, without the idea of
freedom. In the plant or in the worm, life has to rise to the individual
concept. It is there, unconsciously working, the plant living its life
to preserve the variety, principle, or form, not nature. The idea of
nature controlling every step onward overrules the idea of freedom.
Onward goes the idea of the material world, onward moves the idea of
freedom. Still the fight goes on. We are hearing about all the quarrels
of creeds and sects, yet creeds and sects are just and proper, they must
be there. The chain is lengthening and naturally the struggle increases,
but there need be no quarrels if we only knew that we are all striving
to reach the same goal.

The embodiment of freedom, the Master of nature, is what we call God.
You cannot deny Him. No, because you cannot move or live without the
idea of freedom. Would you come here if you did not believe you were
free? It is quite possible that the biologist can and will give some
explanation of this perpetual effort to be free. Take all that for
granted, still the idea of freedom is there. It is a fact, as much so as
the other fact that you cannot apparently get over, the fact of being
under nature.

Bondage and liberty, light and shadow, good and evil must be there, but
the very fact of the bondage shows also this freedom hidden there. If
one is a fact, the other is equally a fact. There must be this idea of
freedom. While now we cannot see that this idea of bondage, in
uncultivated man, is his struggle for freedom, yet the idea of freedom
is there. The bondage of sin and impurity in the uncultivated savage is
to his consciousness very small, for his nature is only a little higher
than the animal's. What he struggles against is the bondage of physical
nature, the lack of physical gratification, but out of this lower
consciousness grows and broadens the higher conception of a mental or
moral bondage and a longing for spiritual freedom. Here we see the
divine dimly shining through the veil of ignorance. The veil is very
dense at first and the light may be almost obscured, but it is there,
ever pure and undimmed — the radiant fire of freedom and perfection. Man
personifies this as the Ruler of the Universe, the One Free Being. He
does not yet know that the universe is all one, that the difference is
only in degree, in the concept.

The whole of nature is worship of God. Wherever there is life, there is
this search for freedom and that freedom is the same as God. Necessarily
this freedom gives us mastery over all nature and is impossible without
knowledge. The more we are knowing, the more we are becoming masters of
nature. Mastery alone is making us strong and if there be some being
entirely free and master of nature, that being must have a perfect
knowledge of nature, must be omnipresent and omniscient. Freedom must go
hand in hand with these, and that being alone who has acquired these
will be beyond nature.

Blessedness, eternal peace, arising from perfect freedom, is the highest
concept of religion underlying all the ideas of God in Vedanta —
absolutely free Existence, not bound by anything, no change, no nature,
nothing that can produce a change in Him. This same freedom is in you
and in me and is the only real freedom.

God is still, established upon His own majestic changeless Self. You and
I try to be one with Him, but plant ourselves upon nature, upon the
trifles of daily life, on money, on fame, on human love, and all these
changing forms in nature which make for bondage. When nature shines,
upon what depends the shining? Upon God and not upon the sun, nor the
moon, nor the stars. Wherever anything shines, whether it is the light
in the sun or in our own consciousness, it is He. He shining, all shines
after Him.

Now we have seen that this God is self-evident, impersonal, omniscient,
the Knower and Master of nature, the Lord of all. He is behind all
worship and it is being done according to Him, whether we know it or
not. I go one step further. That at which all marvel, that which we call
evil, is His worship too. This too is a part of freedom. Nay, I will be
terrible even and tell you that, when you are doing evil, the impulse
behind is also that freedom. It may have been misguided and misled, but
it was there; and there cannot be any life or any impulse unless that
freedom be behind it. Freedom breathes in the throb of the universe.
Unless there is unity at the universal heart, we cannot understand
variety. Such is the conception of the Lord in the Upanishads. Sometimes
it rises even higher, presenting to us an ideal before which at first we
stand aghast — that we are in essence one with God. He who is the
colouring in the wings of the butterfly, and the blossoming of the
rose-bud, is the power that is in the plant and in the butterfly. He who
gives us life is the power within us. Out of His fire comes life, and
the direst death is also His power. He whose shadow is death, His shadow
is immortality also. Take a still higher conception. See how we are
flying like hunted hares from all that is terrible, and like them,
hiding our heads and thinking we are safe. See how the whole world is
flying from everything terrible. Once when I was in Varanasi, I was
passing through a place where there was a large tank of water on one
side and a high wall on the other. It was in the grounds where there
were many monkeys. The monkeys of Varanasi are huge brutes and are
sometimes surly. They now took it into their heads not to allow me to
pass through their street, so they howled and shrieked and clutched at
my feet as I passed. As they pressed closer, I began to run, but the
faster I ran, the faster came the monkeys and they began to bite at me.
It seemed impossible to escape, but just then I met a stranger who
called out to me, "Face the brutes." I turned and faced the monkeys, and
they fell back and finally fled. That is a lesson for all life — face
the terrible, face it boldly. Like the monkeys, the hardships of life
fall back when we cease to flee before them. If we are ever to gain
freedom, it must be by conquering nature, never by running away. Cowards
never win victories. We have to fight fear and troubles and ignorance if
we expect them to flee before us.

What is death? What are terrors? Do you not see the Lord's face in them?
Fly from evil and terror and misery, and they will follow you. Face
them, and they will flee. The whole world worships ease and pleasure,
and very few dare to worship that which is painful. To rise above both
is the idea of freedom. Unless man passes through this gate he cannot be
free. We all have to face these. We strive to worship the Lord, but the
body rises between, nature rises between Him and us and blinds our
vision. We must learn how to worship and love Him in the thunderbolt, in
shame, in sorrow, in sin. All the world has ever been preaching the God
of virtue. I preach a God of virtue and a God of sin in one. Take Him if
you dare — that is the one way to salvation; then alone will come to us
the Truth Ultimate which comes from the idea of oneness. Then will be
lost the idea that one is greater than another. The nearer we approach
the law of freedom, the more we shall come under the Lord, and troubles
will vanish. Then we shall not differentiate the door of hell from the
gate of heaven, nor differentiate between men and say, "I am greater
than any being in the universe." Until we see nothing in the world but
the Lord Himself, all these evils will beset us and we shall make all
these distinctions; because it is only in the Lord, in the Spirit, that
we are all one; and until we see God everywhere, this unity will not
exist for us.

Two birds of beautiful plumage, inseparable companions, sat upon the
same tree, one on the top and one below. The beautiful bird below was
eating the fruits of the tree, sweet and bitter, one moment a sweet one
and another a bitter. The moment he ate a bitter fruit, he was sorry,
but after a while he ate another and when it too was bitter, he looked
up and saw the other bird who ate neither the sweet nor the bitter, but
was calm and majestic, immersed in his own glory. And then the poor
lower bird forgot and went on eating the sweet and bitter fruits again,
until at last he ate one that was extremely bitter; and then he stopped
again and once more looked up at the glorious bird above. Then he came
nearer and nearer to the other bird; and when he had come near enough,
rays of light shone upon him and enveloped him, and he saw he was
transformed into the higher bird. He became calm, majestic, free, and
found that there had been but one bird all the time on the tree. The
lower bird was but the reflection of the one above. So we are in reality
one with the Lord, but the reflection makes us seem many, as when the
one sun reflects in a million dew-drops and seems a million tiny suns.
The reflection must vanish if we are to identify ourselves with our real
nature which is divine. The universe itself can never be the limit of
our satisfaction. That is why the miser gathers more and more money,
that is why the robber robs, the sinner sins, that is why you are
learning philosophy. All have one purpose. There is no other purpose in
life, save to reach this freedom. Consciously or unconsciously, we are
all striving for perfection. Every being must attain to it.

The man who is groping through sin, through misery, the man who is
choosing the path through hells, will reach it, but it will take time.
We cannot save him. Some hard knocks on his head will help him to turn
to the Lord. The path of virtue, purity, unselfishness, spirituality,
becomes known at last and what all are doing unconsciously, we are
trying to do consciously. The idea is expressed by St. Paul, "The God
that ye ignorantly worship, Him declare I unto you." This is the lesson
for the whole world to learn. What have these philosophies and theories
of nature to do, if not to help us to attain to this one goal in life?
Let us come to that consciousness of the identity of everything and let
man see himself in everything. Let us be no more the worshippers of
creeds or sects with small limited notions of God, but see Him in
everything in the universe. If you are knowers of God, you will
everywhere find the same worship as in your own heart.

Get rid, in the first place, of all these limited ideas and see God in
every person — working through all hands, walking through all feet, and
eating through every mouth. In every being He lives, through all minds
He thinks. He is self-evident, nearer unto us than ourselves. To know
this is religion, is faith, and may it please the Lord to give us this
faith! When we shall feel that oneness, we shall be immortal. We are
physically immortal even, one with the universe. So long as there is one
that breathes throughout the universe, I live in that one. I am not this
limited little being, I am the universal. I am the life of all the sons
of the past. I am the soul of Buddha, of Jesus, of Mohammed. I am the
soul of the teachers, and I am all the robbers that robbed, and all the
murderers that were hanged, I am the universal. Stand up then; this is
the highest worship. You are one with the universe. That only is
humility — not crawling upon all fours and calling yourself a sinner.
That is the highest evolution when this veil of differentiation is torn
off. The highest creed is Oneness. I am so-and-so is a limited idea, not
true of the real "I". I am the universal; stand upon that and ever
worship the Highest through the highest form, for God is Spirit and
should be worshipped in spirit and in truth. Through lower forms of
worship, man's material thoughts rise to spiritual worship and the
Universal Infinite One is at last worshipped in and through the spirit.
That which is limited is material. The Spirit alone is infinite. God is
Spirit, is infinite; man is Spirit and, therefore, infinite, and the
Infinite alone can worship the Infinite. We will worship the Infinite;
that is the highest spiritual worship. The grandeur of realising these
ideas, how difficult it is! I theorise, talk, philosophize; and the next
moment something comes against me, and I unconsciously become angry, I
forget there is anything in the universe but this little limited self, I
forget to say, "I am the Spirit, what is this trifle to me? I am the
Spirit." I forget it is all myself playing, I forget God, I forget
freedom.

Sharp as the blade of a razor, long and difficult and hard to cross, is
the way to freedom. The sages have declared this again and again. Yet do
not let these weaknesses and failures bind you. The Upanishads have
declared, "Arise ! Awake ! and stop not until the goal is reached." We
will then certainly cross the path, sharp as it is like the razor, and
long and distant and difficult though it be. Man becomes the master of
gods and demons. No one is to blame for our miseries but ourselves. Do
you think there is only a dark cup of poison if man goes to look for
nectar? The nectar is there and is for every man who strives to reach
it. The Lord Himself tells us, "Give up all these paths and struggles.
Do thou take refuge in Me. I will take thee to the other shore, be not
afraid." We hear that from all the scriptures of the world that come to
us. The same voice teaches us to say, "Thy will be done upon earth, as
it is in heaven," for "Thine is the kingdom and the power and the
glory." It is difficult, all very difficult. I say to myself, "This
moment I will take refuge in Thee, O Lord. Unto Thy love I will
sacrifice all, and on Thine altar I will place all that is good and
virtuous. My sins, my sorrows, my actions, good and evil, I will offer
unto Thee; do Thou take them and I will never forget." One moment I say,
"Thy will be done," and the next moment something comes to try me and I
spring up in a rage. The goal of all religions is the same, but the
language of the teachers differs. The attempt is to kill the false "I",
so that the real "I", the Lord, will reign. "I the Lord thy God am a
jealous God. Thou shalt have no other gods before me," say the Hebrew
scriptures. God must be there all alone. We must say, "Not I, but Thou,"
and then we should give up everything but the Lord. He, and He alone,
should reign. Perhaps we struggle hard, and yet the next moment our feet
slip, and then we try to stretch out our hands to Mother. We find we
cannot stand alone. Life is infinite, one chapter of which is, "Thy will
be done," and unless we realise all the chapters we cannot realise the
whole. "Thy will be done" — every moment the traitor mind rebels against
it, yet it must be said, again and again, if we are to conquer the lower
self. We cannot serve a traitor and yet be saved. There is salvation for
all except the traitor and we stand condemned as traitors, traitors
against our own selves, against the majesty of Mother, when we refuse to
obey the voice of our higher Self. Come what will, we must give our
bodies and minds up to the Supreme Will. Well has it been said by the
Hindu philosopher, "If man says twice, 'Thy will be done,' he commits
sin." "Thy will be done," what more is needed, why say it twice? What is
good is good. No more shall we take it back. "Thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven, for Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory
for evermore."

[^1]: Philadelphia (Φιλαδέλφεια) is the word employed by the Apostle
    Paul in his Epistle to the Romans (xii, 10). Philadelphia, as
    employed by the Apostle to the Gentiles, is rendered in our English
    version by "brotherly love." A word of the same origin is used by
    the Apostle at Peter, where (1 Pet. Ill. 8) he gives the injunction
    "love as brethren.” Sophos (σοφός) is the Greek term found in that
    text: "Professing themselves to be *wise* they became fools."
    (Bom. 1. 22.). The words just cited accurately describe the
    character of a sophist. A word derived from sophos is the word
    employed in this question: “Whence hath this man this *wisdom*?”
    (Matt. xiii, 54.) (Wallace 263).

[^9]: "Transcendence" is a word one is reluctant to use freely, for it
    has the tone, the imprint of the special, the holy. According to the
    dictionary, "to transcend" simply means "to rise above or go beyond
    a limit, exceed, excel"; also "to go beyond the universe and time."
    "Transcendence" has placed itself in the domain of religion, where
    it is on holy ground and protected from casual usage. That the word
    is used in all religions is unsurprising since it covers an area
    passing human knowledge, while expressing the hopes and expectations
    of all true believers (Erikson, 124).

[^48]: Dr. S. Radhakrishnan explained—"Bhagwa or the Saffron denotes
    renunciation or disinterestedness. Our leaders must be indifferent
    to material gains and dedicate themselves to their work. The white
    in the centre is light, the path of truth to guide our conduct. The
    green shows our relation to (the) soil, our relation to the plant
    life here, on which all other life depends. The "Ashoka Chakra" in
    the centre of the white is the wheel of the law of dharma. Truth or
    satya, dharma or virtue ought to be the controlling principle of
    those who work under this flag. Again, the wheel denotes motion.
    There is death in stagnation. There is life in movement. India
    should no more resist change, it must move and go forward. The wheel
    represents the dynamism of a peaceful change (Government of India).”
